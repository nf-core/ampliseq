## nf-core/ampliseq version 2.2.0dev

### `Added`

* [#352](https://github.com/nf-core/ampliseq/pull/352) - `--skip_dada_addspecies` allows to skip species level classification to reduce memory requirements, incompatible with `--sbdiexport` and `--cut_its` that expect species annotation
* [#354](https://github.com/nf-core/ampliseq/pull/354) - Input files and files after primer trimming with cutadapt are required to be >1KB (i.e. not empty) and either the pipeline will stop if at least one sample file fails or the failing samples will be ignored when using `--ignore_empty_input_files` or `--ignore_failed_trimming`, respectively.
* [#364](https://github.com/nf-core/ampliseq/pull/364) - Adonis in QIIME2 for testing feature importance in beta diversity distances, `--qiime_adonis_formula` can be set to provide a custom formula.
