### `Removed`

## nf-core/ampliseq version 2.3.2 - 2022-05-27

- [#396](https://github.com/nf-core/ampliseq/pull/396) - Barrnap annotates ASV sequences for SSU's, it can be skipped with `--skip_barrnap`. `--filter_ssu` takes a comma separated list of "bac,arc,mito,euk" and enables SSU filtering depending on Barrnap (default: off).
