### FastQC

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `fastqc/`
    * `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics for your untrimmed raw fastq files.

</details>

### Cutadapt

[Cutadapt](https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200) is trimming primer sequences from sequencing reads. Primer sequences are non-biological sequences that often introduce point mutations that do not reflect sample sequences. This is especially true for degenerated PCR primer. If primer trimming would be omitted, artifactual amplicon sequence variants might be computed by the denoising tool or sequences might be lost due to become labelled as PCR chimera.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `cutadapt/`: directory containing log files with retained reads, trimming percentage, etc. for each sample.
    * `cutadapt_summary.tsv`: Summary of read numbers that pass cutadapt.
    * `assignTaxonomy.cutadapt.log`: Contains how many expected amplified sequences were extracted from the DADA2 reference taxonomy database. Optional.

</details>

### MultiQC

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `multiqc/`
    * `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
    * `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
    * `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

> **NB:** The FastQC plots displayed in the MultiQC report shows _untrimmed_ reads. They may contain adapter sequence and potentially regions with low quality.

### DADA2

[DADA2](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3869) performs fast and accurate sample inference from amplicon data with single-nucleotide resolution. It infers exact amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from amplicon data with fewer false positives than many other methods while maintaining high sensitivity.

DADA2 computes an error model on the sequencing reads (forward and reverse independently), therefore quality filtering or paired read merging may not be performed before. Each sequencing run varies in their error profile and it is recommended that DADA2 runs separately on data from each run individually. It is recommended to use the ampliseq option `--multiple_sequencing_runs` to analyse such data.

DADA2 reduces sequence errors and dereplicates sequences by quality filtering, denoising, read pair merging (for paired end Illumina reads only) and PCR chimera removal.

Additionally, DADA2 taxonomically classifies the ASVs using a choice of supplied databases (specified with `--dada_ref_taxonomy`).

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

The red line shows the error rates expected under the nominal definition of the Q-score. The estimated error rates (black line) should be a good fit to the observed rates (points), and the error rates should drop with increased quality.
    * `*_qual_stats.pdf`: Overall read quality profiles: heat map of the frequency of each quality score at each base position. The mean quality score at each position is shown by the green line, and the quartiles of the quality score distribution by the orange lines. The red line shows the scaled proportion of reads that extend to at least that position.

#### ITSx

Optionally, the ITS region can be extracted from each ASV sequence using ITSx, and taxonomic classification is performed based on the ITS sequence.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `itsx/`
    * `ASV_ITS_seqs.full.fasta`: Fasta file with ITS region from each ASV sequence.

### QIIME2

**Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2** ([QIIME2](https://qiime2.org/)) is a next-generation microbiome bioinformatics platform and the successor of the widely used [QIIME1](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.f.303).

ASV sequences, counts, and taxonomic classification as produced before with DADA2 are imported into QIIME2 and further analysed. Optionally, ASVs can be taxonomically classified also with QIIME2 against a database chosen with `--qiime_ref_taxonomy` (but DADA2 taxonomic classification takes precedence). Next, ASVs are filtered (`--exclude_taxa`, `--min_frequency`, `--min_samples`), and abundance tables are exported. Following, diversity indices are calculated and testing for differential abundant features between sample groups is performed.

#### Taxonomic classification

Taxonomic classification with QIIME2 is typically similar to DADA2 classifications. However, both options are available. When taxonomic classification with DADA2 and QIIME2 is performed, DADA2 classification takes precedence over QIIME2 classifications for all downstream analysis.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `qiime2/taxonomy/`
    * `taxonomy.tsv`: Tab-separated table with taxonomic classification for each ASV
    * `*-classifier.qza`: QIIME2 artefact of the trained classifier. Can be supplied to other pipeline runs with `--classifier`
    * `ref_taxonomy.txt`: Information about the used reference taxonomy, such as title, version, citation.

</details>

#### Exclude taxa

Removes unwanted taxa in DADA2 output sequences and abundance tables by taxonomic classification. Unwanted taxa are often off-targets generated in PCR with primers that are not perfectly specific for the target DNA. For example, PCR with commonly used primers also amplifyies mitrochindrial or chloroplast rRNA genes and therefore leads to non-bacteria products. These mitrochondria or chloroplast amplicons are removed in this step by default (`--exclude_taxa`). The tables are based on the computed taxonomic classification (DADA2 classification takes precedence over QIIME2 classifications).

All following analysis is based on these filtered tables.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `qiime2/representative_sequences/`
    * `rep-seq.fasta`: Fasta file with ASV sequences.
    * `descriptive_stats.tsv`: Length, mean, etc. of ASV sequences.
    * `seven_number_summary.tsv`: Length of ASV sequences in different quantiles.
* `qiime2/abundance_tables/`
    * `abs-abund-table-*.tsv`: Tab-separated absolute abundance table at taxa level `*`, where `*` ranges by default from 2 to 6 or 7, depending on the used reference taxonomy database.
    * `count_table_filter_stats.tsv`: Tab-separated table with information on how much counts were filtered for each sample.
    * `feature-table.biom`: Abundance table in biom format for importing into downstream analysis tools.
    * `feature-table.tsv`: Tab-separated abundance table for each ASV and each sample.

</details>

#### Relative abundance tables

Absolute abundance tables produced by the previous steps contain count data, but the compositional nature of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing requires sequencing depth normalisation. This step computes relative abundance tables for various taxonomic levels and detailed tables for all ASVs with taxonomic classification, sequence and relative abundance for each sample. Typically used for in depth investigation of taxa abundances. If not specified, the tables are based on the computed taxonomic classification (DADA2 classification takes precedence over QIIME2 classifications).

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `qiime2/rel_abundance_tables/`
    * `rel-table-*.tsv`: Tab-separated absolute abundance table at taxa level `*`, where `*` ranges by default from 2 to 6 or 7, depending on the used reference taxonomy database.

</details>

#### Barplot

<summary>Output files</summary>

* `qiime2/barplot/`
    * `index.html`: Interactive barplot for taxa abundance per sample that can be viewed in your web browser.

</details>

#### Alpha diversity rarefaction curves

Produces rarefaction plots for several alpha diversity indices, and is primarily used to determine if the richness of the samples has been fully observed or sequenced. If the slope of the curves does not level out and the lines do not becomes horizontal, this might be because the sequencing depth was too low to observe all diversity or that sequencing error artificially increases sequence diversity and causes false discoveries.

<details markdown="1">

* `qiime2/alpha-rarefaction/`
    * `index.html`: Interactive alphararefaction curve for taxa abundance per sample that can be viewed in your web browser.

</details>

#### Diversity analysis

Diversity measures summarize important sample features (alpha diversity) or differences between samples (beta diversity). To do so, sample data is first rarefied to the minimum number of counts per sample. Also, a phylogenetic tree of all ASVs is computed to provide phylogenetic information.

<details markdown="1">

    * `tree.nwk`: Phylogenetic tree in newick format.
    * `rooted-tree.qza`: Phylogenetic tree in QIIME2 format.

</details>

##### Alpha diversity indices

Alpha diversity measures the species diversity within samples. Diversity calculations are based on sub-sampled data rarefied to the minimum read count of all samples. This step calculates alpha diversity using various methods and performs pairwise comparisons of groups of samples. It is based on a phylogenetic tree of all ASV sequences.

<details markdown="1">

    * `evenness_vector/index.html`: Pielou’s Evenness.
    * `faith_pd_vector/index.html`: Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (qualitiative, phylogenetic).
    * `observed_otus_vector/index.html`: Observed OTUs (qualitative).
    * `shannon_vector/index.html`: Shannon’s diversity index (quantitative).

</details>

##### Beta diversity indices

Beta diversity measures the species community differences between samples. Diversity calculations are based on sub-sampled data rarefied to the minimum read count of all samples. This step calculates beta diversity distances using various methods and performs pairwise comparisons of groups of samples.
Additionally principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots are produced that can be visualized with [Emperor](https://biocore.github.io/emperor/build/html/index.html) in your default browser without the need for installation. This calculations are based on a phylogenetic tree of all ASV sequences.
Furthermore, ADONIS permutation-based statistical test in vegan-R determine whether groups of samples are significantly different from one another. By default, all metadata columns that are for suitable pairwise comparisons will be tranformed into a formula, e.g. "treatment1+treatment2". A custom formula can be supplied with `--qiime_adonis_formula`.

**The following methods are used to calculate community dissimilarities:**

* Jaccard distance (qualitative)
* Bray-Curtis distance (quantitative)
* unweighted UniFrac distance (qualitative, phylogenetic)
* weighted UniFrac distance (quantitative, phylogenetic)

</details>

#### ANCOM

Analysis of Composition of Microbiomes ([ANCOM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26028277)) is applied to identify features that are differentially abundant across sample groups. A key assumption made by ANCOM is that few taxa (less than about 25%) will be differentially abundant between groups otherwise the method will be inaccurate.

ANCOM is applied to each suitable or specified metadata column for 5 taxonomic levels (2-6).

</details>

### PICRUSt2

PICRUSt2 (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) is a software for predicting functional abundances based only on marker gene sequences. On demand (`--picrust`), Enzyme Classification numbers (EC), KEGG orthologs (KO) and MetaCyc ontology predictions will be made for each sample.

PICRUSt2 is preferentially applied to filtered data by QIIME2 but will use DADA2 output in case QIIME2 isnt run.

> **NB:** Quantifications are not normalized yet, they can be normalized e.g. by the total sum per sample.

### SBDI export

You can use the `--sbdiexport` flag (or `sbdiexport = true` in a nextflow config file) to generate tab separated files in preparation for submission to the [Swedish Biodiversity Infrastructure (SBDI)](https://biodiversitydata.se/).

Tables are generated from the DADA2 denoising and taxonomy assignment steps.
Each table, except `annotation.tsv`, corresponds to one tab in the [submission template](https://asv-portal.biodiversitydata.se/submit).
See [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md) for further information.
Most of the fields in the template will not be populated by the export process, but if you run Ampliseq with a sample metadata table (`--metadata`) any fields corresponding to a field in the template will be used.
